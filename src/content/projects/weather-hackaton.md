# Eneko Weather

## What is it?

Is an application that shows the current weather in a given location.

The application is based on the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This project was made for a `Hackathon` created by [Midudev](https://midu.dev) in Eneko.

The point of this application is to show a different way of designing an application that is way times made with material ui or glassmorphisms etc, giving a try to the originality and `freedom of color expression`.

## Stack and Inspiration

- Front end made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
- Styling Inspirated in a new Design trend called NeuBrutalism [Example](https://theoutline.com/)

## Features

As simple as showing the current weather given a location.

You can also see the weather in a selected location, as well three days ahead.

Once opened a forecast day, you will see the weather in that day.

In addition to that, you can select between two different themes (`default` and `wero`(my gf theme)).

## Where to see it?

The Project is deployed with [netlify](https://nelify.com) in a custom domain, so you can access it from any device.
