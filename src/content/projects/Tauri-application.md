# Modern Desktop App Template

Tauri and React boilerplate for a modern desktop application. Not a project nor a substitute tutorial for my video tutorials. I didn't use yew (wasm) since its component libraries are not to the calibre of existing React component libraries.

## Instructions

1. Install Tauri [prerequisites](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/prerequisites)
2. Download or Clone this repository `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/elibroftw/modern-desktop-app-template.git new-app`
3. Go into `new-app`
4. Run `yarn` to install packages
5. While `yarn` is working,
    - Edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json's productName, identifier, title`
    - Edit `src/App.jsx's HEADER_TITLE, FOOTER`
    - Remove the `.git` folder
    - Edit `SAMPLE_README.md` and replace `README.md`
    - Delete or replace `LICENSE.md` since this template is public domain
8. Run `yarn dev` to start developing
9. Read [Tips and Trouble Shooting](#tips) section of the new `README.md`
10. If any problems arise, open an issue or contact me

## Old Instructions

1. Follow only the Tauri [prerequisites](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/prerequisites)
2. Install yarn with `npm i -g yarn`
3. Create the frontend project with `yarn create vite APP-NAME --template react[-ts]` and enter a package-name if you have to
4. Run `yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli && yarn tauri init` in the newly created directory
5. Now copy the contents of each file in this repo (excluding `README.md` and `LICENSE.md`) into the corresponding file of your project. For example my `package.json`. 
6. Run `yarn` to install dependencies (ignore warnings)
7. Run `yarn dev` to start developing

I do not recommend pulling from my repo because you will need to edit the same files I reorganize

## Screenshots

- The four views not found in boilerplate were added by yours truly. My About is the ViewExample provided in `src`
- `Home view` is purposely not translated since it's a filler
