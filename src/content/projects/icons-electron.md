# Electron Icons

## Why

The only reason why I did this project is because I always see lots of websites that serve public icons on the web and I save them all, which then I don't use, for that reason I've
decided to create one project my own, using the icons I get from them and copying or using them from here.

This way, as is something I created myself, there is no way to forget I have something for icons, at least I hope I won't.

## How

How is simple, is just some vanilla js and a bunch of HTML nothing else, and with the help of electron to build the desktop application.

If you ask why I did it with electron, I wanted to have it on my desktop offline as I see it handier for this use case.
I thought on doing it in flutter or even Swift, but I wasn't in the mood of learning all the necessary things for it.

I may do it at some point if I get bored of doing this in Electron.
